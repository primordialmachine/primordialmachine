# Building the Program
To compile this program, you generate your environment-specific build files using the KitWare's CMake.

- Ensure KitWare's CMake is installed on your system and is in your path.
  To assert CMake is properly installed, open a console and enter `cmake --help`. The programs should be found and print its help text.
- Check out this repository to some folder. Henceforth we will denote that folder by the placeholder name `<source>`.
- Create a folder outsode of `<source>`. Henceforth, we will denote that folder by the placeholder name `<build>`.
- To generate the Visual C++ project files in the folder `<build>`, open a console, enter the folder `<build>` and enter `cmake <source>`.

The above will use the x64 of x86 generator depending on your system.
To specifically choose one generator, enter `cmake -A x64 <source>` for x64 and `cmake -A Win32 <source>` for x86.
