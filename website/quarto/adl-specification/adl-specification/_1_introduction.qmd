# Introduction
This document is the manual for version 1 of the *Asset Definition Language* (short: *ADL*).
Programs of this language describe assets lf audio-visual virtual environments for the purpose
of storing and exchanging those assets between entities (humans and machines alike).

The *ADL* is a *DDL*-based language (see <https://develop.primordialmachine.com/ddl-specification> for more information).
