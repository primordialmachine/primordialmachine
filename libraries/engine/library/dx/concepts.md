# Applications and Scenes
An application is a sequence of transitions of scenes.

## Scenes
We introduce the concept of a scene and a scene execution environment:
A scene is a independent unit of (audial/visual/haptical) input and output which is created, destroyed, and operated by a scene execution environment.
This interaction is based on an interface between scenes and scene execution environments.
